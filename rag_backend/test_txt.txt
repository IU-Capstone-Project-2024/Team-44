NASA's Perseverance Rover has successfully landed on Mars, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing quest to explore the Red Planet. The rover, which touched down in the Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021, is equipped with a suite of advanced scientific instruments designed to search for signs of ancient microbial life and collect samples of Martian rock and soil for future return to Earth. The mission is expected to last at least one Martian year, or about 687 Earth days.
